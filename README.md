# Web Development Project 4 - **DoggoDex - Catch all Doggos!**

Submitted by: **Tashi Sherpa**

This web app: Stumble upon random doggos in the wild by clicking "Discover ðŸ”€". Don't want to look for a certain type of attribute? Click the attribute to send it to the banned queries tab (to prevent future encounters of doggos with this attribute). See what you've captured in the captured doggos tab as well! Happy catching!

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [x] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Personal grammatical articles in the stored history (a, an) based on vowels.

## Notes

I had some trouble linking my API key to my web app (due to naming errors with vite-project-app - all variables in .env must start with VITE\_). I got this alleviated after an hour.
Another concern was my busy schedule this week, causing me to spend a late submit as a result, and also missing the Unit 5 lecture.
